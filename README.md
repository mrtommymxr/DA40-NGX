**Key Features.**

1. **Automatic propeller control** 
Using a SimConnect module, we are able to control prop RPM based on the power output of the engine. This acts like Single lever Control, however its based on engine output and not lever position 

2. **Engine changes** 
* Proper fuel flows 
* Changed Oil/Coolant temp and pressure behaviour
* Increased thrust scalar

3. **Compatibility with the Working Title G1000 mod****
* Added Engine, Systems and Fuel page
* Added fuel/Gearbox temperature indications 
* CAS messages added

4. **Flightmodel**
* Correct cruise speeds
* Increased Fuel capacity to 19.5 gal per side
* Reduced elevator and rudder sensitivity
* Improved Cl table and stall characteristics
* Improved inflight handling characteristics all around
* Decreased ground friction 
* Added nose wheel steering
* Increased flap lift and drag
* Decreased trim deflection

5. **Systems**
* Improved outside lighting
* Improved autopilot PIDs and limitations
* Engine Indications Connected to Engine Master switches
* Ammeter behaves correctly to engine state

**Todo:**
* Flightmodel: Correct performance and feel all around
* Systems: Redo everything, Full G1000- FADEC integration 
* Alot more
